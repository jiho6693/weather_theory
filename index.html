online, 2006.

          <br><br>
          "The Eye of the Storm: Visual Perception and the Weather" provides a detailed exploration of the relationship between weather phenomena and visual perception. The article examines how we perceive and interpret weather conditions through our visual senses. It delves into the mechanisms of visual perception and how they impact our understanding and experience of weather phenomena such as storms, rain, clouds, and atmospheric conditions.
          <br><br>
          Visual cues play a significant role in how we perceive and make sense of weather. For example, we can visually discern approaching storms by observing the gathering dark clouds or anticipate rain when we see droplets falling. These visual cues aid in predicting weather changes and adapting accordingly.
          <br><br>
          Furthermore, weather itself influences visual perception. On clear days, our field of vision widens, colors appear vibrant, and sunlight creates a brighter, vivid world. In contrast, cloudy or foggy days restrict our field of vision, and colors may appear muted, altering our visual perception.
          <br><br>
          The article sheds light on the fascinating interplay between weather and visual perception, providing insights into how we perceive and understand the weather around us. By exploring how weather is visually perceived and the ways it influences our responses, we gain a deeper understanding of how our visual senses shape our interactions with weather phenomena.</p>

        Miwon Kwon, “One Place after Another: Site-Specific Art and Locational Identity”,    
The MIT Press, 2002.
<br><br>
        Miwon Kwon argues that site-specific art derives its meaning and experience from the physical, cultural, and social characteristics of the place in which it is created and displayed. Such artworks interact with the history, culture, and identity of the specific location, and viewers become aware of their own locational identity through the interaction between the artwork and the site.
<br><br>Additionally, Kwon discusses how site-specific art can offer dynamic and participatory experiences when it moves beyond traditional art spaces and unfolds in public or unconventional locations. This allows viewers to engage with artworks outside of the confines of museums or galleries, fostering new perspectives and experiences.
<br><br>"Miwon Kwon, 'One Place after Another: Site-Specific Art and Locational Identity'" provides a profound understanding of the relationship between art and place, examining how the connection and interaction between artwork and location shape our locational identity.
