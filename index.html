          Tim Ingold, “The eye of the storm: visual perception and the weather”, Essay, Published 
online, 2006.

          <br><br>
          "The Eye of the Storm: Visual Perception and the Weather" provides a detailed exploration of the relationship between weather phenomena and visual perception. The article examines how we perceive and interpret weather conditions through our visual senses. It delves into the mechanisms of visual perception and how they impact our understanding and experience of weather phenomena such as storms, rain, clouds, and atmospheric conditions.
          <br><br>
          Visual cues play a significant role in how we perceive and make sense of weather. For example, we can visually discern approaching storms by observing the gathering dark clouds or anticipate rain when we see droplets falling. These visual cues aid in predicting weather changes and adapting accordingly.
          <br><br>
          Furthermore, weather itself influences visual perception. On clear days, our field of vision widens, colors appear vibrant, and sunlight creates a brighter, vivid world. In contrast, cloudy or foggy days restrict our field of vision, and colors may appear muted, altering our visual perception.
          <br><br>
          The article sheds light on the fascinating interplay between weather and visual perception, providing insights into how we perceive and understand the weather around us. By exploring how weather is visually perceived and the ways it influences our responses, we gain a deeper understanding of how our visual senses shape our interactions with weather phenomena.</p>

        Miwon Kwon, “One Place after Another: Site-Specific Art and Locational Identity”,    
The MIT Press, 2002.
<br><br>
        Miwon Kwon argues that site-specific art derives its meaning and experience from the physical, cultural, and social characteristics of the place in which it is created and displayed. Such artworks interact with the history, culture, and identity of the specific location, and viewers become aware of their own locational identity through the interaction between the artwork and the site.
<br><br>Additionally, Kwon discusses how site-specific art can offer dynamic and participatory experiences when it moves beyond traditional art spaces and unfolds in public or unconventional locations. This allows viewers to engage with artworks outside of the confines of museums or galleries, fostering new perspectives and experiences.
<br><br>"Miwon Kwon, 'One Place after Another: Site-Specific Art and Locational Identity'" provides a profound understanding of the relationship between art and place, examining how the connection and interaction between artwork and location shape our locational identity.
<br><br>
“... with its stark white walls, artificial lighting (no windows), controlled climate, and pristine architectonics, was perceived not solely in terms of basic dimensions and proportion but as an institutional disguise, a normative exhibition convention serving an ideological function. The seemingly benign architectural features of a gallery/museum, in other words, were deemed to be coded mechanisms that actively disassociate the space of art from the outer world, furthering the institution’s idealist imperative of rendering itself and its values “objective,” “disinterested,” and “true.”

        Tung-Hui Hu, "A prehistory of the Cloud", The MIT Press, 2016.<br><br>
        Tung-Hui Hu explores the evolution of cloud computing from its inception in the 1960s to modern cloud systems. He explains how cloud computing has gained significant influence in areas such as technology, economy, politics, and military.
<br>The book covers key events and concepts related to the development of cloud computing. Tung-Hui Hu emphasizes that cloud computing brings about new forms of control and management for user data and personal information. Additionally, he examines the social, political, and cultural implications of cloud computing alongside its technical aspects.

‘How to View Emptiness

Of course, the idea that the cloud is inherently political may not be so new.

Further, one of the curious dilemmas that the cloud represents is that not even the engineers who have built it typically know where the cloud is, and, as a consequence, what part of the apparatus to examine. 
<br>
1. Representations and anticipations of the cloud in US popular media, legal and political records, corporate advertisements and ephemera, and the like. 
<br>
2. Examples drawn from the culture of computer science itself: the terms, metaphors, and diagrams that show how scientists and hackers understood their subjects—descriptions, to be clear, which often failed or succeeded purely by practice rather than technological superiority.
<br>
3.Photographs, drawings, videos, and even games that offer insight into how visual culture functions in the cloud’ 	p18

        John Durham Peters, "The Marvelous Clouds",University of Chicago Press, 2015.
        <br><br>


        When we speak of clouds these days, it is as likely that we mean data clouds or network clouds as cumulus or stratus. In their sharing of the term, both kinds of clouds reveal an essential truth: that the natural world and the technological world are not so distinct. In The Marvelous Clouds, John Durham Peters argues that though we often think of media as environments, the reverse is just as true—environments are media.
        <br><br>
        Peters defines media expansively as elements that compose the human world. Drawing from ideas implicit in media philosophy, Peters argues that media are more than carriers of messages: they are the very infrastructures combining nature and culture that allow human life to thrive.  Through an encyclopedic array of examples from the oceans to the skies, The Marvelous Clouds reveals the long prehistory of so-called new media. Digital media, Peters argues, are an extension of early practices tied to the establishment of civilization such as mastering fire, building calendars, reading the stars, creating language, and establishing religions. New media do not take us into uncharted waters, but rather confront us with the deepest and oldest questions of society and ecology: how to manage the relations people have with themselves, others, and the natural world.
        <br><br>
        A wide-ranging meditation on the many means we have employed to cope with the struggles of existence—from navigation to farming, meteorology to Google—The Marvelous Clouds shows how media lie at the very heart of our interactions with the world around us.  Peters’s  book will not only change how we think about media but provide a new appreciation for the day-to-day foundations of life on earth that we so often take for granted.
